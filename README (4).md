# AI-Powered Stock Trading Simulation Platform

A modular, agentic trading simulator where AI agents mimic real-world investor strategies and execute trades based on live market data, research tools, and persistent memory. Built as part of an advanced autonomous agents course by Ed Donner.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Agent-Based Trading**: Simulates traders like Warren Buffett, Ray Dalio, George Soros, and Cathie Wood.
- **Real-Time & EOD Market Data**: Integrates with the Polygon API for real or delayed stock prices.
- **Research Agent**: Nested LLM researcher with Brave search, web fetch, and memory.
- **Autonomous Execution**: Agents make decisions, execute trades, send push updates, and self-log.
- **Live Dashboard**: View trader performance via a real-time Gradio UI.
- **SQLite Persistence**: Accounts, transactions, logs, and market data stored persistently.
- **Modular Microservices**: MCP-based server tools for accounts, markets, research, and push notifications.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

- `trading_floor.py` — Main loop, launches and schedules traders
- `traders.py` — Trader class definition, model setup, and decision logic
- `accounts.py` — Account logic (buy, sell, PnL, strategy)
- `market.py` — Share price engine using Polygon API
- `push_server.py` — Push notifications using Pushover
- `alpha_client.py` — Connects to Smithery (optional external research)
- `templates.py` — Prompt instructions for traders and researchers
- `database.py` — SQLite layer for accounts, logs, and market history
- `app.py` — Gradio dashboard with charts and logs

## 🔧 Tool Server Configuration

| Server   | Script                              | Purpose               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Market   | `market_server.py` or `mcp_polygon` | Share prices          |
| Accounts | `accounts_server.py`                | Trading actions       |
| Push     | `push_server.py`                    | Notifications         |
| Research | `brave-search`, `fetch`, `memory`   | News and memory tools |

Launch configuration is controlled via `mcp_params.py`

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Scheduler loop starts and checks market status.
2. Each trader agent is launched with their own persona and model.
3. The agent receives account + strategy context, performs research, and executes trades.
4. Tools are invoked via subprocess (MCP protocol): `buy_shares`, `lookup_share_price`, etc.
5. Logs and transactions are saved and visualized in real-time.
6. Push notifications summarize each trade session.

## 🖥️ Dashboard

To run the Gradio UI:

```bash
python app.py
```

- View live holdings, transactions, PnL
- Logs update every 0.5 seconds
- Charts update every 2 minutes
